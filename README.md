# Collaboration and Pull Requests in Git

Collaboration is a key aspect of successful project management, and Git provides powerful tools for working together on code. In this document, we'll explore how to use Git for collaboration, especially when it comes to creating and managing pull requests.

## Introduction

Collaboration in Git involves sharing code changes both locally and remotely. Git offers a range of features to streamline the process, including handling conflicts, tracking work, and contributing to projects hosted on platforms like GitHub.

## Collaborative Development Platforms

GitHub, among other platforms, has gained immense popularity for fostering collaboration across various projects. It allows anyone to learn, contribute, and collaborate on code. Let's dive into some essential concepts and workflows for effective collaboration.

## A Simple Pull Request on GitHub

A pull request (PR) is a fundamental mechanism for suggesting changes to a project on GitHub. It allows you to propose code modifications, enhancements, or bug fixes to a repository you don't have direct access to. Here's how to create a simple pull request on GitHub.

### Forking a Repository

1. Start by navigating to the repository you want to contribute to.
2. Click the "Fork" button to create a personal copy of the repository under your GitHub account.
3. Now, you have your own forked repository where you can make changes.

### Editing Files and Committing Changes

1. Locate the file you want to modify and click the pencil icon to edit it directly on the web interface.
2. GitHub will automatically create a forked copy, a new branch, and allow you to make changes.
3. Edit the file, fix the issue, or make improvements.
4. Provide a clear commit message explaining your changes.
5. Commit your changes to your forked repository.

### Creating a Pull Request

1. After committing, GitHub will prompt you to create a pull request.
2. Review your changes and provide additional context in the description box.
3. Click "Create pull request" to submit your changes for review by the repository owner.
4. Your pull request is now available for review. The repository maintainers will assess your changes and decide whether to merge them.

## The Typical Pull Request Workflow on GitHub

While the previous section covered creating pull requests directly through the GitHub interface, for more complex changes, it's advisable to work with a local copy of the repository. This allows you to preview and test changes before submitting a pull request.

### Creating a Local Fork

1. Go to the repository you want to contribute to.
2. Click the "Fork" button to create a fork under your GitHub account.
3. Clone the forked repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
4. You now have a local copy of the repository to work on.

### Making and Pushing Changes

1. Create a new branch for your changes using `git checkout -b branch-name`.
2. Make your desired code changes, create new files, or add documentation.
3. Commit your changes with clear messages.
4. Push your branch to your forked repository using `git push origin branch-name`.
5. Your changes are now in your forked repository on GitHub, ready for a pull request.

### Creating a Pull Request

1. Visit your forked repository on GitHub.
2. Click "Compare & pull request" to create a new pull request.
3. Review the changes and provide context in the comment box.
4. Click "Create pull request" to submit your request.
5. Your pull request is created and can be reviewed by the repository maintainers.

### Updating an Existing Pull Request

- It's common to receive feedback on your pull request, prompting you to make further improvements. Here's how to update an existing pull request.

### Addressing Feedback

1. Review comments and feedback provided by project maintainers.
2. Make necessary changes in your local repository.
3. Commit these changes with clear messages.
4. Push the changes to your existing branch in your forked repository.
5. Your pull request will automatically update with the new commits.

## Squashing Changes

- Sometimes, project maintainers may ask you to squash your commits into a single commit before merging. This can be done using an interactive rebase.

### Squashing Commits

1. Run `git rebase -i master`, specifying the base branch.
2. A text editor will open, showing a list of commits.
3. Change "pick" to "squash" for the commits you want to squash.
4. Save and close the editor.
5. Another editor will open to allow you to modify the combined commit message.
6. Save and close the editor.
7. Your commits are now squashed into a single commit with an updated message.

## Forking, Cloning, and Pull Requests in Git

This guide explains essential Git operations for collaborating on projects, including forking a repository, cloning it to your local machine, creating branches, making and committing changes, and creating and updating pull requests.

### Forking a Repository

To fork a repository on GitHub using the web interface:

1. Visit the repository you want to fork on GitHub.
2. Click the "Fork" button, and GitHub will create a fork under your account.

### Cloning a Repository to Your Local Machine

To clone your forked repository to your local machine:

```shell
# Replace 'your-username' with your GitHub username and 'repo-name' with the repository name.
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
cd repo-name
```

### Creating a New Branch for Your Changes

Create a new branch in your local repository to work on your changes:

```shell
# Replace 'branch-name' with your desired branch name.
git checkout -b branch-name
```

- Make changes to your code.

```shell
# Stage your changes for commit.
git add .
```

### Commit your changes with a clear message.

```shell
git commit -m "Fix the typo in validation.py"
```

### Pushing Your Changes to Your Forked Repository

Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub:

### Replace 'branch-name' with the name of the branch you created.

```shell
git push origin branch-name
```

## Creating a Pull Request
After pushing your changes, create a pull request from your GitHub account:

- Visit your forked repository on GitHub.
- Click "New Pull Request" to start the pull request process.
- Review your changes and provide a description.
- Click "Create Pull Request" to submit your pull request.

## Updating an Existing Pull Request

If you receive feedback on your pull request and need to make updates:

```shell
# Make changes in your local branch based on the feedback.
# Stage and commit your changes.
git add .
git commit -m "Address feedback from code review"

# Push the changes to your branch in your forked repository.
git push origin branch-name
```

## Squashing Commits

To squash multiple commits into a single commit interactively:

```shell
# Start an interactive rebase against the base branch (e.g., master).
git rebase -i master

# In the text editor that opens, change "pick" to "squash" (or "s") for the commits you want to squash.
# Save and close the text editor.

# Another text editor will open for the combined commit message. Modify it as needed.
# Save and close the text editor.

# Force push the changes to your forked repository.
git push -f origin branch-name
```

# Code Reviews

## Understanding the Code Review Workflow

### Introduction

This document explores the code review process, which is essential for improving code quality and collaboration in software development.

### The Code Review Process

#### Requesting a Code Review

1. After completing a set of code changes, developers typically ask a reviewer to evaluate their work.

#### Reviewer's Feedback

1. Reviewers examine the code and provide feedback.
    - This feedback can include suggestions for improvement and identifying issues.

#### Addressing Review Comments

1. Developers address review comments, making necessary changes.
    - This may involve fixing typos, adding missing tests, or implementing suggested improvements.

#### Marking Comments as Resolved

1. After addressing a comment, it can be marked as resolved to indicate that it has been addressed.

#### Seeking Clarification

1. Developers can seek clarification from reviewers by replying to comments if they are unsure about a particular issue or suggestion.
    - Comments that need further discussion are not marked as resolved.

#### Approval and Merging

1. Once all comments have been resolved, and the reviewer is satisfied, they approve the changes.
2. The approved changes can then be merged into the codebase.

### Understanding Review Comments

#### Types of Comments

1. Reviewers may provide a range of comments, including:
    - Critical issues that require significant fixes.
    - Minor suggestions for code improvement, often labeled as "Nits."

#### Improving Code Clarity

1. It's essential to use feedback as an opportunity to enhance code clarity.
    - This can involve improving variable names or breaking down complex code into smaller functions.
    - Adding comments and documentation to explain the "how" and "why" of code.

#### Style Guide Adherence

1. Code reviews often include comments about coding style.
2. Referring to a project-specific style guide, such as PEP8 for Python, can help streamline discussions about code style.

### Code Review Tools

#### Approval Workflow

1. Different code review tools may have varying approval workflows.
   - Some require approval from project maintainers, while others need a few "+1s" from contributors.

#### Ensuring Quality

1. The goal is to ensure that code changes have been reviewed by individuals familiar with the project, ensuring its readiness for submission.

### The Value of Code Reviews

#### Benefits

1. Code reviews benefit projects of all sizes and complexities.
   - They facilitate team agreement on coding standards and approaches.
   - They provide a second set of eyes to identify issues and improvements.

## Tracking Issues in Project Management

Collaboration and project management are crucial when working with others on a project. Without proper coordination, there's a risk of overlapping efforts and missing critical tasks. Imagine a scenario where you and your colleagues are working on building automation software for your network, but there's no clear plan. This could lead to chaos, incompatible software, and unaddressed gaps in the project.

## The Challenge of Collaboration

In small teams, discussing responsibilities is manageable in person. However, as the group grows, managing responsibilities becomes more challenging. This is where issue trackers and bug trackers come to the rescue.

### What Is an Issue Tracker?

An issue tracker is a tool that helps coordinate work within a team. It keeps track of tasks, their status, and who is responsible for them. Additionally, users can add comments to issues, which can provide essential details about the problem, suggest solutions, or describe testing procedures.

Issue trackers aren't just for project team members. They also allow users to report bugs and issues they encounter, even if they don't know how to fix them. This helps improve projects by identifying unforeseen problems and inconsistencies. Moreover, issue trackers are valuable for volunteers interested in contributing to a project, as they provide a clear list of pending tasks.

## Types of Issue Trackers

Various solutions are available for tracking bugs and issues. Two popular options include:

### 1. Bugzilla

Bugzilla is a widely-used bug tracker, especially in the open-source community. Many projects rely on it to manage their issues and tasks.

### 2. GitHub Issue Tracker

GitHub, a popular platform for hosting projects, comes with an integrated issue tracker. This built-in tool simplifies issue management, making it convenient for projects hosted on GitHub.

## Using an Issue Tracker in Practice

Let's explore how to use an issue tracker, focusing on GitHub's issue tracker.

### Creating a New Issue

1. Go to the project's issue section.
2. Click the "New issue" button.
3. Provide a title for the issue, e.g., "Check for Critical Errors in System Logs."
4. In the issue description, specify the details of the task, such as checking var/log/currentlog and var/log/syslog for critical errors.

### Managing Issues

Issues in the tracker are uniquely identified by numbers. GitHub automatically references issues and pull requests when you mention them using the hashtag format (e.g., #2). This simplifies cross-referencing and tracking.

### Assigning Issues

Assigning issues to collaborators helps track who is working on what. By assigning a bug to yourself, you signal to others that you are taking responsibility for it.

### Closing Issues

When resolving an issue through a pull request, you can automatically close the issue upon merging. Include a string like "closes:#4" in your commit message or pull request description. GitHub will then close the issue and link it to the new commit.

## Real-World Example

Consider a scenario where we need to update documentation for a project called "health-checks." There is an issue requesting this update.

### Updating Documentation

1. Assign the issue to yourself.
2. Make the necessary updates to the documentation.
3. Commit the changes with a message like "Updated README for new script name."
4. Include "closes #1" to automatically close the associated issue when the commit is merged.
5. Push the commit to the repository.

### Closing the Issue

GitHub automatically closes the issue when the commit is pushed. You can click on the commit ID to see the associated change and reference to the issue.

This guide provides a basic understanding of tracking issues in project management. There are more advanced techniques and features to explore, but this should give you a solid foundation for efficient collaboration and issue tracking.

# Automated Testing, Continuous Integration, and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

Throughout this course, we've been making changes to our files, sometimes we ran them manually to test if they still worked after the change, sometimes we just forgot to do that. This is common for any software project no matter how big or small. As humans, we're not great at remembering to do lots of stuff so we can't rely on people remembering to test their code, not even ourselves. Luckily, we don't need to. We can write automated tests to test the code for us and then use a continuous integration or CI system to run those tests automatically.

## Continuous Integration (CI)

A continuous integration system will build and test our code every time there's a change. This means that it will run whenever there's a new commit in the main branch of our code. It will also run for any changes that come in through a pull request. In other words, if we have continuous integration configured for our project, we can automatically run our tests using the code in a pull request. This way, we can verify that the test will pass after the new changes get merged back into the tree and that means instead of hoping our collaborators will remember to properly test their code, we can rely on our automated testing system to do it for us.

## Continuous Deployment (CD)

Once we have our code automatically built and tested, the next automation step is continuous deployment which is sometimes called continuous delivery or CD. Continuous deployment means the new code is deployed often. The goal is to avoid rollouts with a lot of changes between two versions of a project and instead do incremental updates with only a few changes at a time. This allows errors to be caught and fixed early. Typical configurations include deploying a new version whenever a commit is merged into the main tree or whenever a branch is tagged for release.

## Tools for CI/CD

There's a large world of tools and platforms related to CI/CD which is what the whole system is usually called. One popular option is Jenkins which can be used to automate lots of different types of projects. Some repository hosting services like GitLab provide their own infrastructure for doing continuous integration. GitHub doesn't offer an integrated solution. Instead, the popular alternative is to use Travis which communicates with GitHub and can access the information from GitHub projects to know which integrations to run. No matter which tool you use, there are a bunch of concepts that you'll need to deal with when creating your own CI/CD.

## CI/CD Concepts

### The first one is the concept of pipelines. 

A pipeline in CI/CD is a series of automated steps or stages that code changes go through from development to deployment. Pipelines are crucial for ensuring that code is thoroughly tested, built, and deployed in a controlled and consistent manner. Here's a breakdown of what pipelines typically include:

- Build: The first stage of a pipeline involves compiling or building the code. This may involve transforming source code into executable binaries or preparing files for deployment.

- Test: After the build stage, automated tests are executed. Testing can include unit tests to check individual code components, integration tests to ensure different parts work together, and end-to-end tests to simulate user interactions.

- Quality Checks: In this stage, code quality checks may be performed. This can involve running static analysis tools to identify coding standard violations, security vulnerabilities, or other issues.

- Deployment: If all previous stages pass successfully, the code is deployed to a test environment. This environment mimics the production environment but is isolated for testing purposes.

- Review and Approval: Some pipelines include a manual review and approval step, where designated team members or stakeholders review the changes and approve them for further deployment.

- Production Deployment: Once approved, the code can be deployed to the production environment. This is often a controlled process with rollback mechanisms in case of issues.

- Monitoring and Feedback: After deployment, the application is monitored for performance, errors, and other issues. Any problems detected are addressed promptly.

### Another concept that turns up when doing CI/CD is artifacts.

Artifacts refer to the output files or packages generated during the CI/CD pipeline. These files are the result of various stages of the pipeline and are often used for deployment or distribution. Here are some common examples of artifacts:

- Compiled Binaries: In programming languages like Java, C++, or Go, the artifact might be the compiled binary files that are ready to run.

- Docker Images: In containerized applications, the artifact can be Docker images that contain the application and its dependencies. These images can be deployed to container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.

- Deployment Packages: For web applications or services, artifacts may include deployment packages like WAR files for Java applications, ZIP files, or tarballs containing the application code.

- Documentation: Sometimes, artifacts include documentation files, such as user manuals, API documentation, or release notes, generated as part of the build process.

- Installer Packages: In desktop or mobile application development, artifacts can be installer packages for different platforms (e.g., Windows Installer, Debian packages, macOS DMG files).

- Reports: In cases where the pipeline generates reports (e.g., test reports, code analysis reports), these reports are also considered artifacts and can be valuable for post-deployment analysis.

- Artifacts are typically stored in a repository or artifact storage system, making them easily accessible for deployment to various environments, sharing with team members, or archiving for future reference.

When setting up CI/CD, we have to be careful about how we manage secrets. If our pipeline includes deploying a new version of the software to a test server, we need to somehow give the software that's running the pipeline access to our test server. There are a bunch of different strategies to do this, like exchanging SSH keys or using application-specific API tokens. For some pipelines, it might be unavoidable to use one of these methods, but be aware that you're giving access to your test servers to the owner of the service that's running the pipeline for you. It's a bit like giving your house keys to the person checking your heating once a year.

## Security Considerations

So two things to remember, first, make sure the authorized entities for the test servers are not the same entities authorized to deploy on the production servers. That way, if there's any kind of compromise in the pipeline, your production server is not affected. Second, always have a plan to recover your access in case your pipeline gets compromised.

## Getting Started with Travis CI (for GitHub Projects)[optional]

If you want to set up Travis for your GitHub project, you can do that by logging into the Travis website at [www.travis-ci.com](https://www.travis-ci.com) using your GitHub account, then enable the projects that you want to continuously integrate. After that, you'll need to add a configuration file to your project written in YAML format that states the language your project is in and which steps to take for the pipeline. This file can be very simple if your project files are typical configuration for the language you're using but can also become very complex if you want to run a complicated pipeline with lots of stages and steps outside the defaults. We won't go into a ton of detail here but there's more info in the next reading coming up. Feel free to read up on it and investigate on your own if you want to continuously integrate and deliver your project.
